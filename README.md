## Diala

Diala is a real-time voice agent application with a focus on clean, guided onboarding experiences.

## What this repo focuses on now
We are primarily documenting and iterating on the onboarding flows. Start with the two docs below to understand the user journeys and the exact components each page imports.

- [Onboarding Flows (narrative walkthrough)](frontend/src/app/onboarding/FLOWS.md)
- [Onboarding Page Imports (component references)](frontend/src/app/onboarding/IMPORTS.md)

## TL;DR
- Read the two onboarding docs above to see what each flow does and how itâ€™s built.
- Use the existing pages under `frontend/src/app/onboarding/` as your source of truth for the current UX.

For development commands and architecture, see `CLAUDE.md`.
