The crew completed a complex job neatly and efficiently. They did a great job of cleaning up the site. The crew had a great work ethic (staying on the job into the evening when the weather was good). Other companies offered to do the job at a lower cost, but we did not have confidence that they would do such a good job. We made the right choice!\n\n![Image 14](blob:http://localhost/dabe910a2ebcf2d72f5731f34cf349d1)\n\nI rent had the good fortune of having Horch Roofing complete a new roof shingling job at my residence. From the project estimator (Bill) to the Project Manager (Jeremy) to the office coordinator (Chelsea) to the actual installation crew, my expectations were exceeded! Clear communication throughout from all members of the Horch team was spot on! I easily will recommend Horch Roofing to anyone considering hiring a roofing contractor.\n\n![Image 15](blob:http://localhost/dabe910a2ebcf2d72f5731f34cf349d1)\n\nFour members of the Horch Roofing team interacted with me over several days. Each of them was courteous and knowledgeable as we worked through the available options. After selecting repair vs replacement, they provided a description, with photos, of the repairs, and a very realistic assessment of the uncertainties that remained. They helped me in making an informed decision and I will happily have them back a second time if replacement is required.\n\n![Image 16](blob:http://localhost/dabe910a2ebcf2d72f5731f34cf349d1)\n\nHorch roofing did a great job communicating the time frame for our metal roof installation and we were pleased with the quality of the work. Additionally, there was no cleanup afterwards. Siding that was damaged was replaced and repainted and all the litter was removed.\n\n![Image 17](blob:http://localhost/dabe910a2ebcf2d72f5731f34cf349d1)\n\nVery pleased with the outcome of the roof of my garage! Great hard working crew and no mess left behind. A new skylight was installed as well, very pleased. I\u2019m a repeat customer, my house roof was installed by Horch Roofing two summers ago.\n\n![Image 18](blob:http://localhost/dabe910a2ebcf2d72f5731f34cf349d1)\n\nHorch Roofing did a new roof on my house a couple of weeks ago and I couldn't be happier. The roof looks great. I love the look of the black architectural shingles and the metal valley gutters. The crew was great. Done in a day and they left everything perfectly clean.\n\nTim\n\n![Image 19](blob:http://localhost/dabe910a2ebcf2d72f5731f34cf349d1)\n\nWorking with Horch was great. They provided a clear quote, got me on the schedule quickly and cleaned up thoroughly.\n\n![Image 20](blob:http://localhost/dabe910a2ebcf2d72f5731f34cf349d1)\n\nThe Horch folks were meticulous. After the bulk of the project was completed, they paid special attention to the cosmetic details so that everything looked perfect!\n\n![Image 21](blob:http://localhost/dabe910a2ebcf2d72f5731f34cf349d1)\n\nHorch Roofing is a very professional, organized entity. It was a very simple process from quoting to planning/scheduling and on to completion. I highly recommend and will use the Horch team for our next roofing project.\n\n![Image 22](blob:http://localhost/dabe910a2ebcf2d72f5731f34cf349d1)\n\nHorch Roofing installed a metal roof on my house in May. They are a great group to work with. Alex did the estimate and answered all my questions and kept in touched with me while I was waiting for the other companies estimates. His estimate was very detailed compared to the other companies. Tori got my work schedule fast and the team that showed up to my house at 7am and left at 2pm. They put down tarps, striped the old asphalt shingles off, and cleaned up the old shingles and nails. The lawn looked like it did before they show up. My new roof looks great and has been through a couple of rain storms and it has no leaks. I am very satisfied with the company..\n\n![Image 23](blob:http://localhost/e8a57f4972516a1d3218894eabc89576)\n\n![Image 24: best of the best of knox county award badge](blob:http://localhost/e8a57f4972516a1d3218894eabc89576)\n\n![Image 25: national roofing contractors association member badge](blob:http://localhost/e8a57f4972516a1d3218894eabc89576)\n\n![Image 26](blob:http://localhost/e8a57f4972516a1d3218894eabc89576)",

      "content": "![Image 1: 5 Signs that You're Dealing with an Unprofessional Roofer](https://jkroofing.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/5-Signs-that-Youre-Dealing-with-an-Unprofessional-Roofer-1024x679.jpg)\n\nYour roof is your home\u2019s first line of defense against inclement weather like [strong hail events](https://jkroofing.com/blog/colorado-storm-season-the-science-of-hail-and-how-to-prepare/) and [wind storms](https://jkroofing.com/blog/colorado-storm-season-the-science-of-wind-and-how-to-prepare-your-roof/). Because of this vital function it serves, you must make sure that your roof is in great condition year-round.\n\nWhen you realize your roof needs some attention\u2014be it a full roof replacement or repairing some damage\u2014you can\u2019t afford to go with a sub-par roofing company. Not all roofing companies are built the same, and unfortunately, there are a lot of roofing scams out there.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the market for roofing work to be done on your house, you need to know how some roofers rip you off so you can steer clear of the bad companies and only work with the best.\n\nHere are five signs that you\u2019re dealing with an unprofessional roofer.\n\n1. They are unresponsive or slow to respond and don\u2019t have a professional presence.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA characteristic trait of an [unprofessional roofing contractor](https://jkroofing.com/blog/5-common-roofing-scams-and-steps-to-avoid-them/) is being slow to respond\u2014or not responding at all. Roofing projects can be complex, and as a result, homeowners can have a lot of questions about the work being done on their property. If your roofer is slow to get back to you when you reach out (or they don\u2019t respond at all), they\u2019re not demonstrating a very high level of professionalism.\n\nIf a roofer doesn\u2019t have a website or any reviews or testimonials online, that\u2019s a major red flag. Every contractor should have an online presence at this point, and be able to show customer reviews or provide references. A good roofing contractor will be delighted to show you their portfolio and prove their expertise to you. They should also be licensed and insured, so you are not liable for damages or incorrect work. Ask to see their licenses and insurance information.\n\n2. They don\u2019t treat your property with respect.\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nIt should go without saying that a guest on your property is expected to act respectfully toward you and your home. An unprofessional roofer might do the opposite by tossing your patio furniture around, leaving trash all over the place, driving onto your grass, etc. You shouldn\u2019t have to deal with this kind of behavior or disrespect from a roofer!\n\nOne of the main jobs of a roofing contractor is protecting your property anytime they\u2019re on your roof. To protect your property they\u2019ll cover your attic, windows, landscaping, move anything on your patio, and stay on only paved surfaces. They will also clean up after the job and use a magnet to sweep for any nails that are on the ground.\n\n3. Their work appears sloppy or uneven and critical materials were left off.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDon\u2019t settle for sloppy work. Roofs should have straight lines that look uniform throughout. If you notice that your roofing contractor\u2019s work appears uneven or just looks bad (including things like mismatched shingles, missing shingles or crooked lines), they may not properly understand [your roofing system](https://jkroofing.com/blog/what-goes-into-a-roof-the-roofing-system-explained/). A professional roofer will take the time to inspect your current roof and create an effective strategy for completing any repairs that need to be addressed.\n\nThere are certain materials that need to be present with roofing. These include decking, flashing, underlayment, drip edges, ice and water shield, vents, ridge capping, boots and shingles or another roofing material. Cutting corners with materials are ways inexperienced contractors think they can save money. They may take advantage of your lack of knowledge.\n\nYour roofing contractor should be a reliable, reputable contractor. You need to be 100% confident in your selection. Key items that show a lack of experience include an incorrect use of roofing nails and nail patterns, improper or missing started shingles, improper installation of underlayment, neglecting to look in your attic and review your ventilation, not planning for ice dams, ignoring product manufacturer\u2019s guidelines and voiding your warranty, and not properly obtaining roof permits.\n\n4. They reuse old materials.\n----------------------------\n\nThis is a classic sign of an unprofessional roofer. When they are repairing or replacing your old roof, they shouldn\u2019t reuse existing materials that may be inferior in quality, damaged, or just old. This applies to things like your flashing, drip edges, underlayment, etc. In some cases, a contractor might offer you a price break to use \u201cleftover\u201d or discounted materials. These \u201cspecial deals\u201d rarely lead to a durable roof. For example, new drip edge flashing is needed anytime you are shingling your roof. It prevents many problems like leaks, decking decay, and keeps insects out of the attic.\n\nYou must have confidence that your roofer has [the right materials](https://jkroofing.com/blog/roofing-materials-guide-which-is-right-for-you/)\u2014and the right knowledge\u2014to get your job done professionally and to your satisfaction.\n\n5. Their business practices seem sketchy.\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThere are a number of roofing scams out there that you must be on the lookout for. Make sure your roofing contractor isn\u2019t a storm chaser from [out of state](https://jkroofing.com/blog/why-should-i-choose-a-local-roofer/), they\u2019re locally licensed and bonded, and they\u2019re registered as a business in Colorado. Don\u2019t fall for their pushy sales strategies or bold-face lies that they were sent by your insurance company without your prior knowledge. These are [signs of a roofing scam](https://jkroofing.com/blog/5-clues-that-a-storm-chaser-is-at-your-door/)!\n\nA couple of other things to watch out for are roofers requiring full payment up front, no written contract is provided, high-pressure today-only sales tactics, mystery damage on your roof, and unexpectedly lower quotes.\n\nGo With the Best Colorado Roofing Company\n-----------------------------------------\n\nA professional roofer in Colorado is one who is knowledgeable, experienced, certified, and professional. Take time to find the best Colorado roofing company near you. You want a company that is going to be around and will stand behind the work they do.\n\nJ&K Roofing has completed over 50,000+ roofing and exterior projects throughout Colorado\u2014specifically the Denver Metro, Front Range, Colorado Springs, and Fort Collins areas\u2014for almost 40 years.
