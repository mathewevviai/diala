# Business Hunter Implementation Guide

## Overview

The Business Hunter is a **GENERAL-PURPOSE** automated business discovery and lead generation system that can find and validate ANY type of business across any industry. Users can configure custom search parameters to discover businesses based on location, industry, size, keywords, or any other criteria. This system transforms the Python-based lead generation process into a flexible, user-friendly web interface with real-time monitoring, workflow management, and data export capabilities.

## Architecture

### System Components

1. **Frontend Dashboard** (`frontend/src/app/dashboard/business-hunter/`)
   - Workflow management interface
   - Real-time progress monitoring
   - Configuration modals
   - Data visualization and export

2. **Backend API Integration** 
   - Phase execution endpoints
   - Real-time status updates
   - Data persistence and retrieval
   - Export functionality

3. **LeadGen Engine** (`migrate/LeadGen/`)
   - 6-phase automated discovery process
   - Search, extract, validate, and report
   - AI-powered content analysis
   - Multi-source data aggregation

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Backend API Development
- Create FastAPI endpoints for workflow management
- Implement phase execution handlers
- Add WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Database integration for persistence

### Phase 2: Frontend Enhancement
- Integrate with backend APIs
- Add real-time status monitoring
- Implement data visualization components
- Create export functionality

### Phase 3: LeadGen Integration
- Adapt Python scripts for API integration
- Implement background task processing
- Add progress tracking and logging
- Error handling and recovery

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization
- End-to-end workflow testing
- Performance optimization
- UI/UX refinements
- Documentation completion
