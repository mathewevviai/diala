## Technical Implementation

### State Management
The main `App` component manages flow state through React hooks:
```typescript
- currentStep: Navigation through steps 1-4
- userName: User's entered name
- selectedAudio: Chosen background audio
- selectedLanguage: Selected language/accent
- selectedVoiceAgent: Chosen AI voice personality
- selectedPitch: Selected conversation purpose
- showLoading/showVerification/showCalling/showWebInterface: Flow control states
```

### Component Communication
- Props drilling for configuration data
- Callback functions for user selections
- Conditional rendering based on flow state

### Navigation
- `OnboardingNav` component shows progress
- Arrow buttons for step navigation
- Validation prevents advancing without required selections
- Back navigation always available

### WebSocket Integration
The `WebVoiceInterface` establishes real-time communication:
- Bidirectional audio streaming
- Text transcript updates
- Connection state management
- Audio level data for visualizations

- **Shadows**: 4px offset shadows (8px when selected)
- **Colors**: 
  - Primary: RGB(0,82,255) blue
  - Accent: Yellow (#FFD700), Orange, Pink, Cyan
  - Backgrounds: Gradient overlays and patterns
- **Typography**: "Noyh-Bold" custom font, uppercase headers

### Animations
- **Selection**: Rotating gold star badge
- **Hover**: Shadow depth increase
- **Loading**: Step-by-step progress animations

## User Experience Flow

### Decision Points
1. **Quick Demo vs Full Customization**: Skip to defaults or configure
2. **Custom Pitch**: Open modal for business-specific configuration
3. **Phone vs Web**: After verification, choose communication channel
