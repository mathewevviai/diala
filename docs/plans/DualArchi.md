Areas of Key Considerations

- How we're menat to ensure that we're working with Backend Systems Located within the  - `projects/projectBozo/diala/backend/src`
we've got thorough documentation of close to if not current impemeneation for most of these eher ebut what we're needing tood is bascially
make it so that as we're contuing into the development of this here that we're going to be makign it so that wer'e able ot cover the following areas within this area as to which the backend rpcoesses must do the follwoing.

1: For Realtime Sentiement analysis create a correspondign behaviour based of of SER Informaiton.

After reading htrough a variet yof papers on the topic of emotional sentiment I've foudn that oru current approach of basically beign baleot ot ensure that we're abelto idnetifity vocie means that we're abel ot haev a sub 60ms resposne tiemthat bacsically make si to shtat we're abelto have it so tha tinside o fhti s ehre that we['re abel to use a variety of techniqeus speicfically the f0 approach which actually takes one of the hdiden parameters adn be bale ot bascially for ht eactual text translation fot he vocie we can tak ei nthe infleviton ppointof hponetics and be abelot bascially make it so tha tinsde ofthis heret ahtww er''re abel ot bascially make it os that we're gogint oa hev ti that we can tkae in this persons voice adn then once we've heard there we're to basically be making it os tha tinsideo fht aht there we're abelt o initale a piencone sleector process whic hc is essentially making it so that we're abel to have it where we can basically take otu thsi infromaiton here in the sense where we cant take a snntieent for it to be a plotted otu poitn of X or O and then we're goignt o be abel to use this here wiht a reasonign model which ihas extremely fawst inference ot intiiate a selector which then will basically alllwo for us to bascially cateogirse how we're goignt o be selecting this here which then is passed ot out final vector search for the smentic menaing and sales tehcnqiue which we're ogignt o beuisjng tot hen make the defined out come of hat we're wanitng to ehar so for emxpeli magine we're callign a roofing company and hte guy picks up the phoen and hes brunt and rude and he's ike I havent got neough time to hear about hti snonsense where i nthe word nonsense is one of the words which his phonetical language would add intenation itno specificlaly we would be essentially neeidng to take htis chunekd content out fo the euqaiton that being bale to ensure that we're acutally bale ot take htis here adn actually manage hwo w'er eogignt obacily serve the correct embedded techniques otu fo the model whilst laos keeping a memeory of theprevious thigns tha twe said so we can guide the way the conversation togo based off of this here so that we're able ot bascially makei so that hti shere will then allow for us to not only have the sentiemnt od hat htyeve said for on inference chocies ot basically make th eovic emode be able to actually say exaclty what we wnat but it would be baleot dleiver specific acadenc e styles by using posodyism sot hat we're abelot bascially ensure that we're goignt odo this here so within this here document what I will be givign you si access ot a conversation that I have had a n LLm which ahs kind of navigated me down thesi way and we're goignt o be maiing it os that ther eis a backend ingesiton method which will basically be for the realtiem ifnerence where were going to be using th erefetence material from the paper "Enhancing Speech Emotion Recognition with Graph-Based Prosodic Fusion" we've throughout this conversation clearly outliend where we wnat togo with this here but we nee dot ensure that it also mathes the otuliend object of what we need toodo is ensure that we're ogignt o be working through this here ina manner where in which we're oging to basiclaly be maming it so that were needing to make it os that htis here is going to be doing what we have otuliend from this here.

2: Understanding the Project Objective.

As I've said before numerous times what we're currently doign is that we're creaitng a backend system which allows for the inference times of opensoruced Models to be worked otgether within a dual arhcietehcture development and production enviromnment for exmapela lot of hte ifnerenc etiems of the sutff that we're workign on will be done on a 4070 8GB windows operated machine whilst there is the counter of this here hwich will be the production enevironemnetnwhcihw ill be using a mixture of AMD Instince mi300 droplets that are running on Rocm compared to the alternative which is the Cuda environment; as for the Environments most of our logic but be correctly mapped and setup so that we're abelt o use both of these Dual Archietecture ppaorache sot aht we're ablto support when the time comes for it both a development and production work flow.

So as to the project objects outline before our current system has mos tof the flows mapped otu speicifclaly fo rthere backend funcitons but the aprt of this here is that all of the ifnroamtion that we cacutally need and the lgoic which we need ot use is abscially alll of it is isndireo tfo the backend sow aht we need todo is bascially we've got heh ifnrastrcutre there to make and choose what we want to use adn what w we want tood with it we jus tneed to expand upo nadn then take osmehting somewhere else and hten amke it so that htat thign will work with what we've got goign on becuase htis is a bit of r afrnaektsteiend machien sow e are bascially creating lgoic around our own endpoitns that hen allwos for us to internally use them to create new thigns so tha twe're relaly making use of this here as a system that will work because the end goal is taht we're ableot bascially make it os tha this her eis absle to abscially be done in a mor eproductive manner and actually a correct  manner point blank period which si one fo the issues which ahppens hen you'r ento thinking of a scaleable system alot of the pretenses to this ehreis that we're needign to abscially make it os that we cna  have allo f this here up and going and are baleot baically make it os that we can use these systems TOGETHER.

3: Ape Together Strong.

So like for example as I previously said wer're goignt o bascially neeidng to make it os that we're abel to todo POSODY EMBEDDING OF SPEECH sof or exmapel we're ogignt o be tkaing in realtime text and hten we're needing to process it adn then needing to creat e aynamic search as oen of the ways were going to have an asynchronous actviity so for exmaple when I was makign some fo the logic for this here before we have it isndie fo the /migrate/gemini-2-live-api-demo where we were bascially maingit so tha tinsid eof this here that we were baelot understand what woudl happen if we made all of these different clients within a javascript environemtn wehrere were goignt o asbcaily be tkaing allo f htes ehere different models sucha s the lieks of the gmeini lvie service spai so that we're abelot make it os tha twere ogignt o haeva realtiem ifnroamtio that was beign formatted otu of a "data" folder which would have mutlipel youtube videos whichwere smenatically labeled based off of the contnet sof htis here usuign an original an d bad wasy of embedddign hte cotnent we nee dot make it os htat we're abel toog throught his here and see what way we were abscially tkaing in this lvie streamed content insid eof thsi here shta twe're able to abscialy make it sotha twe cana heva ell fo htis here ifnriomation well work so the working files we had for thish erewas orignally 


`chatterbox-client.js  elevenlabs-client.js  orpheus-client.js` so these here were the wya that were ableot bascially able ot connec tot eh abckend and that we were baelot pass over the stuff from this hereintoti so were ogignt o bascially neeidng to make it for isnide of the cevelopemne tenvironment make it osthat were acutally hitittng an endpoitna dnthat were basically needing to ensure that for this here that were goignt o nly be usng the chatterbox-stremaign mdoelw hcih is the same as if you see htroiughotu  the stpe sof the /onboarding/cloning we're abel to process via `Enter TikTokers name -> yt-dlp download the content -> demucs (seperate th speaker tracks) -> take the seperated and cleand up audio seource sout of thsi her eand thenc reate/rpdocue srt content form this here usign th whsiepr informaiton inside of this here. 

So we're going to be doing the same kidn fo logic here but specifically when we're ogignt obe using ht esmeenatic udnerstandign of the user tha ti spsekaign so taht we're abelo t bascially make it os that we're goignt o haev a realtime ifnerence procesisng of hwo someone is basically meototionally stating somethign so that we're bael to have it so that wer egoing ened it so for exmaple wherre we cna plot otu the X , O from the paper that i had mentioned above and discussed in very much depth to be able to bascially todo this here so weneed rot work throught hsi here sot hat wer ebale to have it so tha this her eifnrioamtion is goignt o bascically be avaialbel when were goignt o be choosing the smenatic menaign fot he covnersatuion peices htat rare isndie of this her.


4: Realtime Infervernce on a Cuda Environemtn is not the same as on a ROcm Envirnoenment.

Due to the nature of what we're doign her ewere goignt o absciaolyl be doing htis here so tha twere bale to optomise this here speicifcally for being on a cuda envirnaoment whcih iv eotuliend priro whcih will be suign a GTX 4070 with 8Gb odf ram adn then then were ogignt oe nsure tha twere balet o abscially have it so that hte ifnerenc espeeds for hti shere will work to the bes tof ht ebailtiy so we're neeidng ot ensure that were baleot have it os that wer eogignt o be monitoring it for a view mtrics soihow likeness to the voces is the clonignjob itself where were ogignt o be taking it out how good of a job we're ableot bascially todo is that we are goign to be workign through the meotional labellign of the chunk text withi nthe whisepr altent space of the selector itself and then we're needign tot ensure that were able to ahgev ti to shtat we reoign to be workign through this here in amnanne rhwere we're bale ot bascially tak ein the persons resposnes eform thiser hevia vocie adn hen be baleot nto jsu tlet the LLmd ecide what they are ogignt od ecid ebtu to see this selection and reasonging proces shappen within a 800ms buffer period so taht were baleo t bascially makei tos htat we cna see all of this here happen in realtime this is an itnegral task that needs ot be doen for this here os it must not obe oversated that we need to ensure tha this here archietechtrue si able ot owikr on bthf of htes ehrer ienvionemtns and re optomsie dot wokr iwhtin both tfo them to a good dgree and rpactice.
