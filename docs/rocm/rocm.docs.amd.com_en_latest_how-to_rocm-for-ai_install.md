 Applies to Linux 

Before getting started, install ROCm and supported machine learning frameworks.

 Pre-install

Each release of ROCm supports specific hardware and software configurations. Before installing, consult the [System requirements](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html "(in ROCm installation on Linux v6.4.1)") and [Installation prerequisites](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/install/prerequisites.html "(in ROCm installation on Linux v6.4.1)") guides.

If you’re new to ROCm, refer to the [ROCm quick start install guide for Linux](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/install/quick-start.html "(in ROCm installation on Linux v6.4.1)").

If you’re using a Radeon GPU for graphics-accelerated applications, refer to the [Radeon installation instructions](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/radeon/en/docs-6.1.3/docs/install/native_linux/install-radeon.html).

ROCm supports multiple [installation methods](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/install/install-overview.html "(in ROCm installation on Linux v6.4.1)"):

*   [Using your Linux distribution’s package manager](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/install/install-methods/package-manager-index.html "(in ROCm installation on Linux v6.4.1)")

*   [Using the AMDGPU installer](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/install/amdgpu-install.html "(in ROCm installation on Linux v6.4.1)")

*   [Multi-version installation](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/install/install-methods/multi-version-install-index.html#installation-types "(in ROCm installation on Linux v6.4.1)")

 Post-install

Follow the [post-installation instructions](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/install/post-install.html "(in ROCm installation on Linux v6.4.1)") to configure your system linker, PATH, and verify the installation.

If you encounter any issues during installation, refer to the [Installation troubleshooting](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/install-faq.html "(in ROCm installation on Linux v6.4.1)") guide.

Machine learning frameworks[#](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/how-to/rocm-for-ai/install.html#machine-learning-frameworks "Link to this heading")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ROCm supports popular machine learning frameworks and libraries including [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch-for-amd-rocm-platform-now-available-as-python-package), [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org/), [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest), and [DeepSpeed](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/opensource/2022/03/21/supporting-efficient-large-model-training-on-amd-instinct-gpus-with-deepspeed/).

Review the framework installation documentation. For ease-of-use, it’s recommended to use official ROCm prebuilt Docker images with the framework pre-installed.

*   [PyTorch for ROCm](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/install/3rd-party/pytorch-install.html "(in ROCm installation on Linux v6.4.1)")

*   [TensorFlow for ROCm](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/install/3rd-party/tensorflow-install.html "(in ROCm installation on Linux v6.4.1)")

*   [JAX for ROCm](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/install/3rd-party/jax-install.html "(in ROCm installation on Linux v6.4.1)")

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After installing ROCm and your desired ML libraries – and before running AI workloads – conduct system health benchmarks to test the optimal performance of your AMD hardware. See [System health benchmarks](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/how-to/rocm-for-ai/system-health-check.html) to get started.
