If you open a pull request and scroll down to the summary panel, there is a commit status section. Next to the line `docs/readthedocs.com:advanced-micro-devices-demo`, there is a `Details` link. If you click this, it takes you to the Read the Docs build for your pull request.

![Image 3: GitHub PR commit status](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/_images/commit-status.png)

If you don’t see this line, click `Show all checks` to get an itemized view.

Command line[#](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/contribute/building.html#command-line "Link to this heading")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can build our documentation via the command line using Python.

See the `build.tools.python` setting in the [Read the Docs configuration file](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/blob/develop/.readthedocs.yaml) for the Python version used by Read the Docs to build documentation.

See the [Python requirements file](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/blob/develop/docs/sphinx/requirements.txt) for Python packages needed to build the documentation.

Use the Python Virtual Environment (`venv`) and run the following commands from the project root:

python3 -mvenv .venv

.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r docs/sphinx/requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python -m sphinx -T -E -b html -d _build/doctrees -D language=en docs _build/html

Navigate to `_build/html/index.html` and open this file in a web browser.

Visual Studio Code[#](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/contribute/building.html#visual-studio-code "Link to this heading")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the help of a few extensions, you can create a productive environment to author and test documentation locally using Visual Studio (VS) Code. Follow these steps to configure VS Code:

1.   Install the required extensions:

    *   Python: `(ms-python.python)`

    *   Live Server: `(ritwickdey.LiveServer)`

2.   Add the following entries to `.vscode/settings.json`.

 {
 "liveServer.settings.root": "/.vscode/build/html",
 "liveServer.settings.wait": 1000,
 "python.terminal.activateEnvInCurrentTerminal": true
 }  
    *   `liveServer.settings.root`: Sets the root of the output website for live previews. Must be changed alongside the `tasks.json` command.

    *   `liveServer.settings.wait`: Tells the live server to wait with the update in order to give Sphinx time to regenerate the site contents and not refresh before the build is complete.

    *   `python.terminal.activateEnvInCurrentTerminal`: Activates the automatic virtual environment, so you can build the site from the integrated terminal.

3.   Add the following tasks to `.vscode/tasks.json`.

 {
 "version": "2.0.0",
 "tasks": [
 {
 "label": "Build Docs",
 "type": "process",
 "windows": {
 "command": "${workspaceFolder}/.venv/Scripts/python.exe"
 },
 "command": "${workspaceFolder}/.venv/bin/python3",
 "args": [
 "-m",
 "sphinx",
 "-j",
 "auto",
 "-T",
 "-b",
 "html",
 "-d",
 "${workspaceFolder}/.vscode/build/doctrees",
 "-D",
 "language=en",
 "${workspaceFolder}/docs",
 "${workspaceFolder}/.vscode/build/html"
 ],
 "problemMatcher": [
 {
 "owner": "sphinx",
 "fileLocation": "absolute",
 "pattern": {
 "regexp": "^(?:.*\\.{3}\\s+)?(\\/[^:]*|[a-zA-Z]:\\\\[^:]*):(\\d+):\\s+(WARNING|ERROR):\\s+(.*)$",
 "file": 1,
 "line": 2,
 "severity": 3,
 "message": 4
 }
 },
 {
 "owner": "sphinx",
 "fileLocation": "absolute",
 "pattern": {
 "regexp": "^(?:.*\\.{3}\\s+)?(\\/[^:]*|[a-zA-Z]:\\\\[^:]*):{1,2}\\s+(WARNING|ERROR):\\s+(.*)$",
 "file": 1,
 "severity": 2,
 "message": 3
 }
 }
 ],
 "group": {
 "kind": "build",
 "isDefault": true
 }
 }
 ]
 }  
> Implementation detail: two problem matchers were needed to be defined, because VS Code doesn’t tolerate some problem information being potentially absent. While a single regex could match all types of errors, if a capture group remains empty (the line number doesn’t show up in all warning/error messages) but the `pattern` references said empty capture group, VS Code discards the message completely.

4.   Configure the Python virtual environment (`venv`).

From the Command Palette, run `Python: Create Environment`. Select `venv` environment and `docs/sphinx/requirements.txt`.

5.   Build the docs.

Launch the default build task using one of the following options:

    *   A hotkey (the default is `Ctrl+Shift+B`)

    *   Issuing the `Tasks: Run Build Task` from the Command Palette

6.   Open the live preview.

Navigate to the site output within VS Code: right-click on `.vscode/build/html/index.html` and select `Open with Live Server`. The contents should update on every rebuild without having to refresh the browser.
