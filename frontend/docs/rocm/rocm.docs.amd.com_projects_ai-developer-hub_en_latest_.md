Tutorials for AI developers
===========================

Tutorials for AI developers[#](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/ai-developer-hub/en/latest/#tutorials-for-ai-developers "Link to this heading")
=================================================================================================================================================

The AI Developer Hub contains AMD ROCm tutorials in Jupyter Notebook format for training, fine-tuning, and inference. It leverages popular machine learning frameworks on AMD GPUs.

These tutorials are organized into four main categories:

*   **Inference**: Resources for running inference with trained models.

*   **Fine-tuning**: Examples and guides for fine-tuning machine learning models.

*   **Pretraining**: Tutorials on pretraining models from scratch.

*   **GPU development and optimization**: Resources for optimizing AI compute and kernel development on GPUs.

All tutorials on the AI Developer Hub are available to download in the Jupyter Notebook format from the public GitHub repository at [ROCm/gpuaidev](https://github.com/ROCm/gpuaidev).
