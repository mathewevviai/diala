{"text": "Mindset:\n\nAct as if you don't need their money; this removes desperation and the need to beg or justify."}

{"text": "Mindset:\n\nThe purpose of a prospecting call is not getting an appointment or making a sale; those are outcomes."}
{"text": "Mindset:\n\nBe prepared to walk away from a deal. This mindset allows you to ask tougher questions and test the prospect's true interest, which helps uncover underlying objections."}

{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nWhen agreeing to send information, schedule a quick follow-up call to review any questions after they've reviewed it."}
{"text": "Example Sales Phrase:\n\n'So, just to clarify, is [the objection] the main thing holding you back?'"}
{"text": "Mindset:\n\nAvoid 'strong-arming' or subtly twisting the prospect's arm into the next step, as it leads to low commitment and high back-out rates."}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nYou cannot answer a question effectively without knowing the motive behind it; it's 'stupid' to try."}

{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nAcknowledge the prospect's stated limitations or current situation. (Relates to AAA: Acknowledge)"}

{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nIf the prospect mentions specific challenges, connect them directly to how your offering could potentially help."}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nCreate a scenario that forces the prospect to reveal the root cause of their interest or lack thereof, enabling them to discover their own need."}
{"text": "Example:\n\nMention a specific example of someone making money with the algorithm trading service on top of their regular job."}

{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nProspects typically give an excuse or stall ('not interested') when a salesperson attempts a traditional close at the end of a meeting."}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nUse a 'surrender close': Frame a hypothetical based on solving their problem (discovered earlier) to get the prospect to suggest the meeting themselves."}
