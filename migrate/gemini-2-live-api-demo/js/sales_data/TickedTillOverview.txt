# TickedTill: Company Overview & Operational Model

## Executive Summary

TickedTill is a pioneering UK-based embedded lending aggregation platform designed to bridge the gap between small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), their customers seeking affordable finance, and a network of regulated finance providers. Operating strategically as an **Introducer Appointed Representative (IAR)**, TickedTill provides the infrastructure and partnerships necessary for businesses to seamlessly integrate consumer credit options (such as Buy Now, Pay Later, instalment plans, and personal loans) directly into their sales processes, without requiring the merchants themselves to hold complex FCA permissions or manage direct lender relationships. Our core mission is to democratise access to responsible finance at the point of need, empowering businesses to increase conversions and sales while offering consumers greater payment flexibility and choice, all within a compliant and robust framework.

## The Problem TickedTill Solves

The modern consumer expects payment flexibility, yet many SMEs face significant barriers when trying to offer financing options:

1.  **Regulatory Complexity:** Becoming directly authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to offer credit or act as a credit broker is a costly, time-consuming, and operationally burdensome process, far beyond the reach or desire of most SMEs focused on their core business.
2.  **Integration Challenges:** Establishing direct partnerships with individual lenders involves complex technical integrations, contract negotiations, and ongoing relationship management for each lender relationship.
3.  **Limited Options:** Relying on a single finance provider often means limited product choice and potentially lower customer approval rates if that provider has narrow underwriting criteria.
4.  **Lost Sales & Lower Conversion:** Without point-of-sale finance, businesses often lose customers who cannot afford the full upfront cost or prefer to spread payments. This friction significantly impacts average order values (AOV) and overall conversion rates, particularly for higher-ticket goods and services.
5.  **Consumer Friction:** Customers needing finance often have to leave the merchant's environment to search for loans independently, creating a disjointed experience and increasing the likelihood of cart abandonment.

TickedTill directly addresses these pain points by providing a unified, compliant, and easy-to-integrate solution.

## The TickedTill Solution: Embedded Lending Aggregation via IAR Model

TickedTill operates a sophisticated B2B2C model built on two core pillars: **Embedded Finance Technology** and a **Regulated Partner Network**.

1.  **Embedded Finance Technology:**
    *   TickedTill provides the technology (APIs, widgets, plug-ins, hosted payment pages) that allows merchants to embed financing offers directly into their customer journey – at checkout, point of quote, invoicing, or even within marketing communications.
    *   We manage the initial customer-facing application flow, ensuring a seamless and branded experience that feels native to the merchant's environment.
    *   Our platform includes intelligent routing capabilities, allowing customer applications to be directed efficiently to the most suitable finance partners within our network based on predefined criteria (e.g., loan amount, product type, merchant sector).

2.  **Regulated Partner Network & IAR Structure:**
    *   Crucially, TickedTill **does not lend money directly**, nor does it provide financial advice or perform credit broking activities under its own authorisation.
    *   Instead, TickedTill is appointed as an **Introducer Appointed Representative (IAR)** by one or more FCA-authorised Principal firms (typically established credit brokers or lenders).
    *   This IAR status allows TickedTill to make compliant introductions of customers seeking finance to its network of **Appointed Representatives (ARs)** and directly authorised firms.
    *   We aggregate a diverse panel of these FCA-regulated finance partners (brokers and direct lenders), each offering different products, risk appetites, and sector specialisms.
    *   This **aggregation model** means merchants integrated with TickedTill gain access to multiple finance providers through a single relationship, increasing the chances of customer approval and offering a wider range of finance products (e.g., short-term BNPL, longer-term instalment loans).

By combining these elements, TickedTill acts as a **compliant distribution and technology layer**, connecting merchants and their customers to a regulated finance ecosystem efficiently and seamlessly.

## How TickedTill Works: The Detailed Flow

The process involves distinct journeys for merchants and their end-customers:

**Merchant Onboarding & Integration:**

1.  **Partnership Agreement:** An SME partners with TickedTill, agreeing to terms of service which outline the IAR relationship and operational flow.
2.  **Integration Setup:** TickedTill provides simple integration tools. This could range from a basic link to a co-branded finance application page, an embeddable widget, a checkout plugin (e.g., for Shopify, WooCommerce), or API integration for bespoke platforms.
3.  **Customisation:** Finance offers and application flows can often be tailored to the merchant's branding and specific product/service offerings.
4.  **Go-Live:** Once integrated, the merchant can immediately start offering finance options to their customers.

**Customer Application Journey:**

1.  **Finance Offer Presented:** A customer shopping with a TickedTill partner merchant sees a clear offer for flexible financing (e.g., "Pay in 3 instalments", "Finance from £X/month", "Check your eligibility").
2.  **Customer Initiates Application:** The customer clicks the offer, initiating the application process within the TickedTill-powered interface (often appearing seamless within the merchant's site).
3.  **Initial Information Capture:** The customer provides basic information required for an initial eligibility check (e.g., name, contact details, income overview, loan purpose/amount). This is handled via TickedTill's secure platform. **TickedTill does not perform underwriting or credit checks.**
4.  **Compliant Introduction & Routing:** Based on the information provided and configured rules, TickedTill identifies the appropriate finance partner(s) (ARs/lenders) within its network. The customer is clearly informed *before* proceeding that they are being introduced to a specific, named, FCA-regulated firm (e.g., "To check your options, we will securely introduce you to [Partner Finance Company Name], who is authorised and regulated by the FCA"). Customer consent is obtained for this introduction.
5.  **Handoff to Finance Partner:** The customer's application details (with consent) are securely passed to the selected finance partner's system. The customer often completes the final stages of the application, including identity verification and hard credit checks (where applicable), directly with the finance partner.
6.  **Underwriting & Decision:** The finance partner (AR or lender) performs the necessary affordability checks, underwriting, and makes the final credit decision.
7.  **Funding & Completion:** If approved, the finance partner manages the loan agreement directly with the customer. Funds are typically disbursed either directly to the merchant (allowing them to fulfil the order) or sometimes to the customer, depending on the finance product. TickedTill is notified of the outcome for commission tracking.

Throughout this process, TickedTill ensures the flow remains compliant with FCA rules regarding introductions and financial promotions.

## Key Stakeholders & Value Propositions

## Regulatory Framework & Compliance

Compliance is paramount to TickedTill's operations. The IAR model is central to this:

*   **IAR Status:** TickedTill acts strictly as an introducer. It does not engage in regulated activities like credit broking (which involves recommending specific credit products), lending, or providing financial advice.
*   **Principal Firm Oversight:** TickedTill's activities related to financial promotions and introductions are overseen by its FCA-authorised Principal firm(s), ensuring adherence to regulatory standards.
*   **Clear Introductions:** TickedTill ensures absolute transparency. Customers are always informed which regulated entity they are being introduced to *before* their data is passed and their consent is secured.
*   **Partner Due Diligence:** TickedTill maintains a network of only FCA-authorised and regulated finance partners (ARs or directly authorised firms), ensuring the end-consumer is always dealing with a compliant entity for the actual credit agreement.
*   **Financial Promotions Compliance:** All marketing materials and presentations of finance options via the TickedTill platform adhere to FCA rules on clarity, fairness, and non-misleading information (CONC 3).
*   **Data Security:** Robust measures are in place to protect customer and merchant data in line with GDPR and industry best practices.

This structure allows TickedTill to facilitate access to finance effectively while ensuring all regulated activities are handled by appropriately authorised firms.

## Market Positioning & Differentiation

TickedTill differentiates itself in the crowded fintech landscape through:

*   **True Aggregation:** Unlike single-provider BNPL solutions or brokers tied to limited panels, TickedTill offers genuine aggregation through its diverse AR network via the IAR model.
*   **Focus on Underserved SMEs:** While major BNPL players target large online retailers, TickedTill focuses on providing embedded finance solutions to a broader range of SMEs, including service-based businesses, trades, clinics, and niche retailers often overlooked.
*   **Compliance-Led Approach:** The IAR structure provides a robust, compliant pathway for SMEs to offer finance, which is a significant advantage over potentially non-compliant or grey-area solutions.
*   **Flexibility & Customisation:** Offers various integration methods and potentially white-labelled solutions tailored to specific industry needs.
*   **Industry Agnosticism:** Designed to deploy across multiple sectors, adapting the finance funnel and partner selection based on the vertical.

## Target Industries

TickedTill's platform is versatile and designed for deployment across numerous sectors where point-of-sale finance can drive significant value, including (but not limited to):

*   Home Improvements (Roofing, Plumbing, Kitchens, Bathrooms, Boilers, Windows)
*   Retail (Higher-ticket goods: Furniture, Electronics, Luxury Items, Jewellery, Bicycles)
*   Automotive (Repairs, Servicing, Parts, Used Car Sales Facilitation)
*   Healthcare & Veterinary (Private Medical Procedures, Dental, Cosmetic Surgery, Fertility Treatments, Pet Care)
*   Education & Training (Professional Courses, Certifications, Bootcamps)
*   Events & Ticketing (Season Tickets, High-Value Concerts/Festivals)
*   Trades & Services (Electricians, Landscapers, Specialist Equipment)
*   Hobbies & Leisure (Musical Instruments, Photography Gear, Sports Equipment)

## Monetization Model

TickedTill operates primarily on a **performance-based commission model**:

*   **Introducer Commissions:** TickedTill earns a commission from its finance partners (ARs/lenders) for each customer successfully introduced who subsequently enters into a credit agreement.
*   **No Direct Merchant Fees (Typically):** In most standard models, the merchant does not pay TickedTill directly for the service, making it a highly attractive proposition. Fees might apply for premium features, bespoke integrations, or potentially tiered subscription models offering enhanced services or cashback incentives.
*   **Value Alignment:** This model ensures TickedTill is incentivised only when a successful outcome occurs for the customer, the merchant (sale completed), and the finance partner (new loan funded).

## Vision & Future

TickedTill aims to become the leading embedded lending aggregation infrastructure for SMEs across the UK. Future plans include expanding the network of finance partners, deepening technological integrations (including richer data analytics for merchants), potentially exploring adjacent value-added services, and scaling operations to serve a rapidly growing portfolio of merchant partners across an even wider array of industries. The focus will remain on providing simple, compliant, and effective finance solutions that empower businesses and consumers alike.
