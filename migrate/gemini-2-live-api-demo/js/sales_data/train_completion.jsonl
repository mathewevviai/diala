{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nUse silence after an objection response; allow the prospect to respond next."}

{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nAfter a prospect indicates disinterest (e.g., in a specific sector's calls), ask 'why' to diagnose the root cause of their frustration."}
{"text": "Mindset:\n\nThere are no such thing as difficult questions. Every question should be handled the same way: you respond with another question."}

{"text": "Example Sales Phrase:\n\n'Compared to what?'"}
{"text": "Mindset:\n\nThe goal of the initial conversation is discovery and diagnosis, not pitching or closing."}

{"text": "Mindset:\n\nUnderstand that if a prospect is giving you objections, it means they are still engaged and interested."}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nRephrase 'not interested' objection to focus on lack of change needed: 'Sounds like you're not looking to make any changes right now.'"}

{"text": "Mindset:\n\nKnow what you fix and how it manifests in the prospect's world. This allows you to ask targeted questions to uncover problems."}

{"text": "Example:\n\nAlternative: Outsource your sales functions. Challenge: Why don't you want to do that?"}
{"text": "Example Sales Phrase:\n\nBecause you're not covered for what you thought you were covered for."}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nChallenge vague statements (e.g., 'in the process') to get to the truth of the situation. Don't accept surface-level answers."}
{"text": "Mindset:\n\nRecognize that 'not interested' can stem from a lack of perceived emotional pain or understanding of risk, not necessarily true disinterest in solving a potential problem."}
{"text": "Mindset:\n\nMaintain detachment from the outcome of a sales interaction, focusing instead on executing the defined sales process correctly."}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nFocus the initial conversation on understanding their current situation and challenges, not on describing your solution in detail."}

{"text": "Example Sales Phrase:\n\nThe eSIM just needs to be installed once, eliminating the need for users to install [multiple times for multiple countries]."}
{"text": "Mindset:\n\nBe emotionally detached from the outcome when using these techniques; if they hang up after you offered, you can't feel bad."}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nUse a specific closing question: 'Based on everything we've talked about, do you feel confident that this is the right solution for you?'"}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nUse presumptive questions: ask a question assuming they know the answer or have already considered something."}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nAddress the prospect's underlying concern after clarifying. Reframe the value based on your core ability (e.g., selling/problem-solving) rather than just specific industry experience."}

{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nWhen a prospect raises an objection, treat it as a question or request for more information rather than a rejection."}
{"text": "Mindset:\n\nView the sales process as guiding the prospect towards a decision, rather than 'selling' them."}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nDon't force the conversation; if the prospect isn't interested or it's not a good fit, acknowledge it politely."}
{"text": "Example Sales Phrase:\n\nDo you think nothing you're doing is impacting the way people treat you?"}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nWhen a meeting feels fractured or adversarial, pull away. Prospects often pull you back in if they want you."}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nSummarize the discussion and confirm understanding after addressing an objection."}

{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nStart the conversation by giving the prospect permission to disengage if they are not interested or if it's not a good fit."}

{"text": "Mindset:\n\nNo is not forever."}
{"text": "Mindset:\n\nYour price reflects your value; don't be cheap."}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nWhen facing an objection, pause and listen actively without interrupting, ensuring you fully grasp the client's concern."}
{"text": "Mindset:\n\nDon't be afraid of silence after asking a question; give the prospect time to think and respond."}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nYour job is to disqualify out, not qualify in. Deal with reasons someone can't buy first."}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nUnderstand how a client typically makes decisions or evaluates options by asking about their process; this helps anticipate and navigate potential objections."}

{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nWhen a prospect agrees to a next step, immediately confirm the logistics (time, date, attendees)."}

{"text": "Mindset:\n\nNot sounding like a typical salesman helps in getting specific information from gatekeepers or prospects."}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nKnowing *when* and *how* to ask questions is more important than the questions themselves. It's about controlling the conversation flow, not just asking."}

{"text": "Example Sales Phrase:\n\nI'd love to work with you, I've just got to see if my boss will pay."}

{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nHandling objections is not about convincing; it's about understanding the other person's perspective and guiding them."}
{"text": "Example Sales Phrase:\n\n\"How does that make you feel?\""}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nLAARC Method: A is for Acknowledge - let them know you heard and understand their concern."}
{"text": "Example:\n\nAlternative: Fire your worst salespeople / Hire better ones. Challenge: Why don't you want to do that?"}

{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nUsing a conditional structure ('hang up now or let me have 30 seconds') as a cold call opener to give control to senior decision-makers, who are often resistant to being told what to do, eliciting a 'no' to hanging up."}

{"text": "Mindset:\n\nApproach the conversation with curiosity and a genuine desire to help the prospect, not just make a sale."}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nBe authentic and yourself to build trust with the prospect."}
{"text": "Mindset:\n\nObjections like 'I don't have time' are often just reflexes to dismiss sales calls, not actual rejections."}
{"text": "Example Sales Phrase:\n\nHave you given up trying to fix it? Do you think this is just the way it's gotta be or do you think if there was a better way...?"}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nDo not try to sell or pitch the gatekeeper anything; focus solely on gaining access based on potential relevance."}
{"text": "Mindset:\n\nView a closed deal not as the end, but the beginning of a long-term relationship centered on partnership."}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nFocus the initial part of a call on asking questions to understand the prospect's current situation and needs, rather than pitching."}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nBased on discovery about the prospect's current situation and future outlook, agree on a clear next step like calling back when the situation might change."}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nConsider charging for the initial strategy/plan development to establish value and commitment early in the process."}

{"text": "Example Sales Phrase:\n\n\"when you turn to your sales guys and you ask them why aren't you hitting target what did they say? ... do you believe those excuses are valid?\""}
{"text": "Example Sales Phrase:\n\n\"I just had a note to give him a call\" when asked about the purpose."}
{"text": "Example Sales Phrase:\n\nCould I ask one last question then and I'll let you go, what's likely to be different do you think in six months?"}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nAddress price objections directly and early by stating you might be too expensive, forcing the prospect to reveal their budget or justify their value perception."}
{"text": "Example Sales Phrase:\n\n\"Okay, too expensive compared to what?\" or \"What were you expecting to invest?\""}

{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nEmploy strategic pauses to emphasize points and encourage the prospect to think or speak."}
{"text": "Mindset:\n\nRecognize that most objections fall into five core categories: No Trust, No Need, No Urgency, No Money, or No Spouse/Partner buy-in."}

{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nUse a permission-based opening that asks for a very short, specific amount of time (e.g., 30 seconds)."}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nWhen handling a price objection, ensure the prospect understands the potential cost or impact of not solving their problem."}
{"text": "Mindset:\n\nBuyers are influenced by the salesperson's conviction in their product and themselves."}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nGet straight to the point in cold calls. People don't have patience for long introductions."}
{"text": "Example Sales Phrase:\n\n\"What specifically about [the product/price/timing] is concerning you?\" is a useful question to explore an objection."}
{"text": "Mindset:\n\nFocus on providing value and solving the prospect's problem, rather than just selling a product."}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nUse the 'unqualified yes' technique to get micro agreements throughout the conversation. These don't mean they will buy."}

{"text": "Mindset:\n\nA good salesman enables the prospect to discover they need what they have, rather than trying to convince them against their will."}
{"text": "Mindset:\n\nFocus on being trusted rather than being liked. Trust comes from competence and a willingness to challenge, which differentiates you."}
{"text": "Mindset:\n\nIf a prospect doesn't recognize the problems you fix, you have nothing to lose by continuing to ask questions to find out what IS going on in their business."}

{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nReframe objections by connecting them back to the prospect's stated goals or challenges."}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nAvoid asking 'Can I send you some information?' or simply stating 'I'll send you an email.'"}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nIf a prospect objects on price, reframe the conversation to focus on the value or ROI the solution provides."}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nUse the 'compared to what?' strategy implicitly by stating prices are cheaper than known competitors like supermarkets and Costco."}

{"text": "Mindset:\n\nUnderstand the difference between strategic volume-based discounting and tactical negotiation discounting."}
{"text": "Mindset:\n\nAgent reflects on not pushing for a meeting when prospect was about to jump into a meeting, questioning if being too respectful was a mistake."}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nApproach prospects from the standpoint that even if they're happy, a rational person would want to know about something significantly better."}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nDo not assume your pitch will instantly convert a prospect into a customer."}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nFor timing objections ('Now isn't a good time'), explore what specifically makes the timing challenging and if delaying could cost them more."}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nIsolate the objection: Confirm with the client if resolving this one specific issue would allow them to move forward."}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nInstead of arguing with an objection, agree with the prospect on some level before presenting your perspective."}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nGo to the top - CEOs will hear you out even if others won't."}
{"text": "Consequence:\n\nAvoiding tough diagnostic questions leads to deals getting stuck in the pipeline's \"graveyard of no decision.\""}

{"text": "Example Sales Phrase:\n\n'The reason for the call is...'"}

{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nHandle objections using the PAC/PAQ method: Pause, Acknowledge, and Clarify/Question."}
{"text": "Example Sales Phrase:\n\n'And how are you guys currently tackling that?'"}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nFrame the investment relative to the potential outcome (revenue gain, cost savings, efficiency) when handling price objections."}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nDo not research companies extensively before a first call. Treat it like a blank slate to encourage the prospect to explain everything, facilitating pure discovery."}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nStart your cold call by asking permission to speak briefly, like 'Would you be open to a quick chat about X?'"}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nThe goal of the first few seconds is to get a meaningful 'yes' and earn slightly more time."}
{"text": "Mindset:\n\nIf a prospect says 'no' to the permission question, it's fine; you likely wouldn't have sold them anyway."}

{"text": "Mindset:\n\nConsistency in results comes from doing the 'how' (process) correctly, which prevents objections."}

{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nConnect your solution directly to closing the cost gap the prospect has identified."}
{"text": "Sales Technique:\n\nReframe the call to action (clicking a link) as an investment in oneself, aligning with the knowledge/growth theme."}
